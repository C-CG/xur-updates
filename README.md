## Xur Updates

In the project directory you will find a React application that displays what items Xur (vendor in Destiny 2) is selling for that specific weekend using the Bungie API and Manifest.

## The Application

## Left to do:
- [ ] When Xur has left for the week display the date and time of his next arrival.
- [ ] Using "Destiny2.GetDestinyManifest" automatically check if the Manifest is up-to-date/download for new devices.
- [ ] Using the Twitter API allow for vendor updates to be automatically tweeted out from [@XurUpdates](https://twitter.com/xurupdates)
- [ ] Responsive Layout.
